\(1:40\) You’ll need to fund your account with ether. I’ll demonstrate how this is done using Metamask, but there are many other ways to fund your Erasure Quant account. Click your metamask wallet to copy your address.

\(1:58\) Then, click the rightmost circle and select the account you’ll be withdrawing from. Click “send”, then ‘transfer between my accounts’. Select the account that you want to make the deposit to. Transfer whatever amount you want by typing in the amount in the ‘amount’ field.

\(3:20\) Once the transaction is confirmed, the ‘stake feed’ and ‘upload data’ buttons will appear on your profile.

\(3:26\) If you click upload data, you’ll see a message and a ‘choose file’ button to upload your predictions. Example predictions are provided to give you a format to follow.

\(3:35\) Click stake feed. Here, you’ll see a message about staking Numeraire. Staking is the mechanism of payment, so if you don’t stake, you don’t earn. Best of luck, quants!
