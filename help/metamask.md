#### [How to use MetaMask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIGUC9JAAw8), a video by ConsenSys

This screencast demonstrates how to use MetaMask, a plugin which enables your browser to connect to the Ethereum blockchain. MetaMask is a key step to interacting with many Ethereum Dapps.   
You can install the MetaMask add-on as a Google Chrome extension, Firefox extension, Opera, and it is compatible with the new Brave browser.   
MetaMask functions as a bridge to the distributed web of tomorrow. It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.
